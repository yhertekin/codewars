Your collegue wrote an simple loop to list his favourite animals. But there seems to be a minor mistake in the grammar, which prevents the program to work. Fix it! :)

If you pass the list of your favourite animals to the function, you should get the list of the animals with orderings and newlines added.

For example, passing in:

animals = [ 'dog', 'cat', 'elephant' ]
will result in:

list_animals(animals) == '1. dog\n2. cat\n3. elephant\n'

    for index, item in enumerate(animals):
